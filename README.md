<h3>Export RSS and Atom feeds URLs from HTML to JSON</h3>

<h4>Task</h4>
Given an HTML document as standard input (you may assume that it is a valid HTML
4.0.1 document), we expect a JSON formatted standard output that contains all the links (the href attributes of all <a> and <link> tags) from the input that point to RSS or Atom feeds, grouped by their type (i.e. into "rss" and "atom" groups).

We consider a link pointing to RSS or Atom feed if the URL is accessible, and served with the proper Content-Type header. Relative links in the input file can be ignored.

You may assume that the system running the script has a reliable network connection and the script
has access to the network. Indenting the output is not necessary, but it has to be a valid JSON format with the proper scheme. You donâ€™t have to validate the internal structure of the RSS or Atom
files, it shall belong to another component of the service.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT <br>
{<br>
"atom": [ "http://example.net/feed", "http://t.co/asdfsf23fdsw234"<br>
],<br>
"rss": [ "http://example.com/rss.xml", "https://example.org/rss2.rss"<>br
]<br>
}<br>
The output must contain both the "rss" and "atom" groups, if there is no link for any of them, they shall be empty arrays.

<h4>Install, requirements</h4>
The script has written in Python3.7.<br>
OS: CentOS Linux ebolla1c.mylabserver.com 3.10.0-957.12.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Apr 29 14:59:59 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
I've installed git and python 3.7:<br>
yum install git<br>
yum groupinstall -y "development tools"<br>
wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/Python-3.7.2.tar.xz<br>
tar xf Python-3.7.2.tar.xz<br>
./configure --enable-optimization<br>
make altinstall<br>
pip3.7 install --upgrade pip<br>
pip3.7 list<br>

It don't need to install the script, only the Python enviroment. Just clone my github repository:
git clone https://github.com/bollae/htmltojason.git

<h4>Usage</h4>
 The script has one positional argument: url. Use the following format: http(s)://url.
 The script downloads the html page, checks it and explores the html code to find rss and atom feed with absolut path. The script search the content type (application/rss+xml or application/atom+xml). Fedds with relative path will be ignored.
<h4>Tests, examples</h4>
<h5>Run script without arguments and use -h</h5>
htmltojason# python3.7 main.py<br>
usage: main.py [-h] url <br>
main.py: error: the following arguments are required: url<br>
htmltojason]# python3.7 main.py -h<br>
