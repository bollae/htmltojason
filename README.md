<h3>Export RSS and Atom feeds URLs from HTML to JSON</h3>

<h4>Task</h4>
Given an HTML document as standard input (you may assume that it is a valid HTML
4.0.1 document), we expect a JSON formatted standard output that contains all the links (the href attributes of all <a> and <link> tags) from the input that point to RSS or Atom feeds, grouped by their type (i.e. into "rss" and "atom" groups).

We consider a link pointing to RSS or Atom feed if the URL is accessible, and served with the proper Content-Type header. Relative links in the input file can be ignored.

You may assume that the system running the script has a reliable network connection and the script
has access to the network. Indenting the output is not necessary, but it has to be a valid JSON format with the proper scheme. You donâ€™t have to validate the internal structure of the RSS or Atom
files, it shall belong to another component of the service.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT <br>
{<br>
"atom": [ "http://example.net/feed", "http://t.co/asdfsf23fdsw234"<br>
],<br>
"rss": [ "http://example.com/rss.xml", "https://example.org/rss2.rss"<>br
]<br>
}<br>
The output must contain both the "rss" and "atom" groups, if there is no link for any of them, they shall be empty arrays.
